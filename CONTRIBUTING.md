Creating a `CONTRIBUTING.md` file is a great way to guide potential contributors through the process of contributing to your project. This file should outline the steps and guidelines for contributing, including how to submit pull requests, file issues, and any coding standards or requirements. Here's a suggested template:

# Contributing to ContextID

First off, thank you for considering contributing to ContextID! It's people like you that make the open-source community such a great place to learn, inspire, and create. Here are some guidelines that we'd like contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

## Getting Started

First, make sure you have Elixir installed on your machine. 

- Fork the repository on GitHub.
- Clone your fork to your local machine:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/getmbi/context_id.git
  ```

- Make sure you're in the right directory:

  ```bash
  cd contextual_id
  ```

- Set up the project dependencies:

  ```bash
  mix deps.get
  ```

## Making Changes

- Create a new branch for your changes:

  ```bash
  git checkout -b your-branch-name
  ```

- Make your changes. Write tests if necessary.
- Run tests to ensure your changes don't break existing functionality:

  ```bash
  mix test
  ```

- Commit your changes with a clear commit message.

  ```bash
  git commit -m "A brief description of your changes"
  ```

## Submitting Changes

- Push your changes to your fork:

  ```bash
  git push origin your-branch-name
  ```

- Submit a pull request through the GitHub website using your branch.

## Reporting Bugs

- Use GitHub Issues to report bugs.
- Describe the bug and include additional details like:
  - The version of ContextID you're using.
  - Relevant system environment details.
  - A clear set of steps to reproduce the bug.

## Code Review Process

Our team looks at Pull Requests on a regular basis. After feedback has been given, we expect responses within a week. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.
